# Arrow Life Game Arrow
writed with Comonad

I am in the process of write the game of life as it's writed here https://www.47deg.com/blog/conway-swift/
but using arrow + compose in place of bow - SwiftUi

# Objectives

- [X] write bow logic with arrow
- [X] write SwiftUi logic with compose
      repo: https://github.com/matiaslev/ArrowComposeLifeGame
- [ ] write property based tests

# Current Bloquer
- [X] I am not seeing the generated code for the type classes on Android.
      The problem was in using compose with kapt. And the workaround used is separete the code that needs kapt from compose in another module.
